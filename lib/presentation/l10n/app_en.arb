  "howItStartedDescription": "I was born in 2001 in Turkey and discovered my passion for software engineering at the age of 14. My first attempt was creating a forum called 'forumtim.com' using Simple Machines Forum (SMF). Though it didn't succeed, I didn't give up.\n\nWhen I started university in the Mathematics department, I dedicated myself to improving in software engineering. I began my journey with Python, like many others, and later transitioned to web development, which led to an internship at Jotform. In 2020, I discovered Flutter, a rising framework at the time, and decided to specialize as a Flutter developer.\n\nSince then, I've worked with several companies, written Medium articles, recorded YouTube videos, and created open-source projects to contribute to the developer community.",
